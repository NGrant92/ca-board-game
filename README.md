# The Hare and Tortoise
A group project to create a console based representation of the board game "The Hare and the Tortoise" for our Java class designed to test/nurture a variety of skills to be utilised in industry. The assignment is meant to teach us Problem Based Learning, Group Co-ordination and an insight to Software Engineering. The assignment was intended to also give practical experience in utilisation of version control technologies.

The final result was a fully functioning game that the professor said she could not break while playing it. It displays an ascii style board to the command prompt that updates and displays the players on the board.

Each square has certain rules so they were split into seperate classes which are called if the player moves onto that square. It is capable of saving and loading games allowing you to pick up where you left off, should something cause your game to be put on hold.
