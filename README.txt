A group project for our Java class. Our group ha to create a text based representation of the board game "The Hare and the Tortoise". The assignment is meant to teach us Problem Based Learning, Group Coordination and an insight to Software Engineering.

The final result was a fully functioning game that the professor said she could not break while playing it. It displays an ascii style board to the command prompt that updates and displays the players on the board.

Each square has certain rules so they were split into seperate classes which are called if the player moves onto that sqaure. It is capable of saving and loading games allowing you to pick up where you left off, should something cause your game to be put on hold.
